title: About me 
---

I've held titles including Developer, QA Engineer, Systems Administrator, and DevOPS Lead. Played with lot of different technology stacks and currently work with "cloud". 

And oh, I try real hard to keep Java, Ruby & node.js from the stack I work on. So far I've been fairly successful; I consider that as an achievement to be proud of.
