The last compiled binary for Windows was v1.7.0. But, I like the newer -y option which dumps out the report in CSV format. With the help of this [patch][iperf-patch], I managed to create a binary for Windows. You can [download it here][download].

Standard disclaimers: Use it at your own risk. I'm uploading this so that it might be of some use to someone. Please don't email me for any support issues; I did not create this software, I just compiled it. It works for me, if it doesn't work for you - tough luck.
